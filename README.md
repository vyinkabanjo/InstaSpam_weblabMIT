# Instaspam

Instaspam allows MIT students to view summaries of dormspam emails in a social media feed format. The website provides options for reading and flagging emails. By default, only unread emails are pulled, so reading an email causes it to disappear from your feed. Flagged emails are displayed on your profile page, which also contains settings.
